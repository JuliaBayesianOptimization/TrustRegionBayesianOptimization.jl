[![Build Status](https://github.com/samuelbelko/TrustRegionBayesianOptimization.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=)](https://github.com/samuelbelko/TrustRegionBayesianOptimization.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3A)

*This repo contains experimental code at the moment.*

This package provides an implementation of Trust Region Bayesian Optimization (TuRBO) algorithm.

## Credits

The TuRBO algorithm was introduced in Scalable Global Optimization via Local Bayesian Optimization by David Eriksson, Michael Pearce, Jacob Gardner, Ryan D. Turner, Matthias Poloczek. 

The above mentioned paper was published in NeurIPS 2019, more information can be found [here](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/6c990b7aca7bc7058f5e98ea909e924b-Abstract.html).


## Licence

This package reuses some implementation tricks from the code-release for the TuRBO algorithm, available at [https://github.com/uber-research/TuRBO/](https://github.com/uber-research/TuRBO/).

Please consult the accompanied `LICENCE.md` file, which coincides with the original licence of the code-release for the TuRBO algorithm mentioned above.
